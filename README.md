# pokemon-data-pipeline
Built an end-to-end data pipeline using Airflow to extract Pokémon data from the public PokéAPI. Processed and transformed JSON data to include stats and metadata, then stored it locally for analysis. Automated ingestion and scheduling with DAGs, demonstrating skills in REST API handling, ETL processes, and workflow orchestration.
